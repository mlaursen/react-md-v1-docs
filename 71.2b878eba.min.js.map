Due to the weirdness in how different mobile devices\\nhandle keyboards, the `dialog` versions of the `EditDialogColumn` do not work on mobile devices.\\nUse the `inline` mode stated below, or go for a better interface on mobile with a row card edit view.\\n\\n#### Default\\nThe default `EditDialog` will just be a small dialog that displays a text field with minimal padding.\\n\\n#### Large\\nA large `EditDialog` will require a `title` prop to display above the text field and then create\\na footer including a cancel and ok button.\\n\\n#### Inline\\nIf you want to keep the UI simple, you can create inline edit dialogs which just display a text field\\nin the cell instead of creating a dialog (so the `EditDialog` is sort of a bad name by this point).\\nBy default, a pencil icon will be added to the right side of the text field to indicate that it can\\nbe typed into (this can also be removed via props).\\n\\n### Keyboard Interactions\\nWhen the user tab-focuses the edit dialog column, the dialog will automatically be opened and the\\ntext field will be focused for text edits. If the user presses tab in an `inline` or non-`large`\\ndialog, the dialog will be closed and the save interaction will be triggered (unless it is switched to\\ndo cancel on outside interactions described above). In any case, if the user presses the escape key,\\nthe dialog will be closed and the cancel action will be called. Since it is sometimes better to not automatically\\nopen the dialog immediately after tab-focus, the auto-open feature can be disabled by disabling `visibleOnFocus`\\nso the user is required to press space or enter to open the edit dialog.\\n\\nWhen the dialog is set to `large`, the tab interactions will be \\\"trapped\\\" within the dialog until the\\nuser selects the ok or cancel button (or presses enter on the text field). The dialog can still be closed\\nby pressing the escape key to cancel any cell edits.\\n\\nWhen the dialog is set to `inline`, tabbing will always save the data and pressing escape will call the\\ncancel action.\\n\\n\\n### TextField\\nThe `EditDialogColumn` uses the [TextField](/components/text-fields) behind the scenes and correctly\\napplies all the props to the text field.
